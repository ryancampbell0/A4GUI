/** Contains methods to read a CS2110 species data file.
 * See the A0 handout for details. Here is an example data file:
 * <pre>
 * Name="Strats Squirrel" 
 * LatinName="Leapus Longus" 
 * Image="Strats_Squirrel.png"
 * Weight=2400
 * Collected-by="Barbara"
 * DNA="CTTAAATTGAGGTGAGCAACTGACGCGAATTGATTGGTTGTGA"
 * </pre>
 * The ideal tool for parsing a line of a data file is regular expressions.
 * For this assignment, you don't have to know how to use them,
 * but in the real world a regex is the fastest and most secure solution.
 * www.Rubular.com is a great tool for developing regular expressions.
